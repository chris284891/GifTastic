With this app I expiremented with the Giphy API (not finished).

# Problem
Create an app that displays GIFs on command.

# Solution
Created divs with an id then called said id with jQuery and rendered buttons based on what items were in the array with a for loop. Then when said button is clicked, it is called in the function with the API call which searches Giphy for all GIFs that have a tag that is the same as the text in the button.

# Feature(s) I Would Like to Add
Way to add buttons for custom Giphy searches.

# Tech
- Giphy API
- jQuery
- HTML 5
- CSS 3

# Instructions
Click the buttons to load the top 10 gifs related to whichever button you clicked. Also add as many band buttons as you want to search their corresponding gifs.

# How to Edit
- Click on green button that says "Clone or download"
- Download zip then extract all
- Then open in text editor of your choice
- If you want to run app locally just open index.html

# Prequisites
Just make sure you have a current updated browser.
